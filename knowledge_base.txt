Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field with a 22-yard pitch in the center. At each end of the pitch is a wicket, which consists of three wooden stumps topped by two bails. The batting team scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket and running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding team tries to prevent this and dismiss each batter.

The origins of cricket are uncertain, but it is believed to have started in south-east England during the 16th century. It became the country's national sport in the 18th century and has developed globally since then. The primary governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 member nations.

There are three main formats of international cricket. Test cricket is the traditional form, played over five days with no limit on the number of overs. One Day Internationals (ODIs) consist of 50 overs per team, while Twenty20 (T20) is a much shorter format with only 20 overs per side. Major international tournaments include the ICC Cricket World Cup (ODI format) and the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, both held every four years. Domestic T20 leagues, such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Australia's Big Bash League (BBL), have become immensely popular worldwide.
